Lingo comes in several different flavors: it's been tested in both Mono and
Microsoft .NET environments, and builds are available for anything since
.NET 3.5.

Once you've added the assembly to your project, you'll need to add a
`using Lingo;` statement to your source code.

## Precompiled Binaries

If you don't want to compile the project from source, compiled DLL files are
available.

.NET versions lower than 3.5 are not currently supported, but you may
be able to get the code working by building from source instead.

* [Lingo for .NET 3.5](http://74.207.240.5/opensource/lingo/net35/Lingo.dll)
* [Lingo for .NET 4.0](http://74.207.240.5/opensource/lingo/net40/Lingo.dll)
* [Lingo for .NET 4.5](http://74.207.240.5/opensource/lingo/net45/Lingo.dll)

## Source Code

Of course, you're also free to build from source as well. All source code can be
found on the project's [GitHub page]({{ site.github }}).
